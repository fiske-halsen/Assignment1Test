## 2. Two Katas

### 1. FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER ###
Use BDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter. 
Use BDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter. 
### 2. ROMAN NUMERAL KATA ###
Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using BDD

#### What was positive and good about using BDD? #### 

As a developer it gave me high visibility in terms of user requirements, since you start out by specifying a behavior, which is written in a simple neutral language. This is great if I was for example working in close collaboration with product owners, analysts or QAs. 

Furthermore it works great to kinda specify the surface behavior and then implement it in the code rather than have more overall focus on the implementation. 

Another good reason is that the application will be documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

#### What was annoying or difficult? ####

We found it difficult to create a behavior implementation in BDD without having a user to interact with an interface. Therefore creating a given when then scenario without a user made it more challenging to communicate with the customer. 

#### What surprised you? ####

It surprised us that we had to combine normal language and then convert it to a programming language. It surprised us as well how agile this approach is and therefore focus was much more on the behavior than the actual implementation. 

#### Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more  ####

Yes indeed, it works great by specifying what behavior you expect for each feature, and therefore kinda gives you clear visibility of what is expected.

#### Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?  ####

Yes as a developer we are rather used to focus on the development of individual components rather having a similar process just on the level of features.
