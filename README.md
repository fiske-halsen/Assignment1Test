## 2. Two Katas 

#### What was positive and good about using BDD? #### 

As a developer it gave me high visibility in terms of user requirements, since you start out by specifying a behavior, which is written in a simple neutral language. This is great if I was for example working in close collaboration with product owners, analysts or QAs. 

Furthermore it works great to kinda specify the surface behavior and then implement it in the code rather than have more overall focus on the implementation. 

Another good reason is that the application will be documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

#### What was annoying or difficult? ####

#### Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more  ####

#### Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?  ####
